# Car Emission Prediction using Linear Regression 🚗💨

This mini project uses a **linear regression model** to predict the **CO2 emission** of vehicles based on their **engine size**.

## 📊 Project Objective
To analyze the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions, and build a predictive model using machine learning (linear regression).

## 🧠 What the Model Does
- Trains a linear regression model on real vehicle data
- Predicts emission levels based on engine size
- Evaluates performance using metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error
  - Mean Squared Error
  - Root Mean Squared Error
  - R² Score
- Visualizes results with a scatter plot and regression line

## 🗂️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

## 📈 Sample Output
- MAE: 27.51
- MSE: 1284.68
- RMSE: 35.84
- R² Score: 0.61

## 📉 Visualization
A scatter plot of training data and the regression line helps visualize how well the model fits.

## 📁 Dataset
A CSV file containing:
- Engine Size
- Emissions

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Use more features like fuel type, cylinders, etc.
- Try polynomial or multivariate regression for better accuracy
