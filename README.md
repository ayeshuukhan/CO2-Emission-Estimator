# CO2 Emission Prediction using Linear Regression ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

This mini project uses a **linear regression model** to predict the **CO2 emission** of vehicles based on their **engine size**.

## Project Objective
To analyze the relationship between engine size and CO2 emissions, and build a predictive model using machine learning (linear regression).

## What the Model Can Do
- Trains a linear regression model on real vehicle data
- Predicts emission levels based on engine size
- Evaluates performance using metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error
  - Mean Squared Error
  - Root Mean Squared Error
  - RÂ² Score
- Visualizes results with a scatter plot and regression line

## Tech Used
- Python 
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Output
- MAE: 27.51
- MSE: 1284.68
- RMSE: 35.84
- RÂ² Score: 0.61

## Dataset
A CSV file containing:
- Engine Size
- Emissions
